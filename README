This project has the goal to learn game development in C++ with visual gameplay.
In the project, we will create a Morpion (or Tic-Tac-Toe) from scratch.
This project will use CMake to compile the project and the library SFML for the graphics.

It will be seperated in 3 directories :
    - src -> All the .cpp files
    - inc -> All the .h files
    - build -> All the files needed by CMake to compile the project
To build the project : 
    - Create a folder build
    - Enter cmake -B build/
    - Enter cmake --build build/

Then you can go to the build directory and use make to compile if you change some files.
